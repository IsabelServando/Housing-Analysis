Analysis of California Housing for a Final Class Project. "Most thorough R code and best presentation across all quarters"


This was my final project for my Introduction to Data Science class, as part of the Data Science Certificate Program at UCLA Extension. Received A+ as my final grade for this class and amazing compliments from my instructor Daniel Gutierrez. I wish I had saved his earlier compliments, too!

Used Random Forest to determine the most important factors that influence values of California houses. Performed feature elimination and fine tuned the Random Forest a few times to get the most optimal RMSE.
