# Housing-Analysis
Analysis of California Housing, a final project for my Introduction to Data Science class, as part of the Data Science Certificate Program at UCLA Extension. 

Received A+ as my final grade and amazing compliments from my instructor Daniel Gutierrez - "Most thorough R code and best presentation across all quarters".  I wish I had saved his earlier compliments, too!

Used Random Forest to determine the most important factors that influence the value of California houses. Performed feature elimination and fine tuned the Random Forest a few times to get the most optimal RMSE.
